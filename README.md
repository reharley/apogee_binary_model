# APOGEE Binary Modeling

---

Currently attempting to approximate the Teff, logg, metals, [A/M] [N/M], [C/M].

Current main project files:
CCF_comparison.py
binModelGen.py

Examples and random code snippets are in in the examples folder. Some are not named well at the moment if I get time I will do so.
