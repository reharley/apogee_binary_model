# APOGEE Binary Modeling
---
Currently attempting to approximate the Teff, logg, metals, [A/M] [N/M], [C/M].

Currently the only mspecGen.py is the only piece working of the project. Will give more details on how everything connects and how it works soon.

Examples and random code snippets are in in the examples folder. Some are not named well at the moment if I get time I will do so.
